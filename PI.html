            <div class="row1">
                <div class="col3">
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our project will be to aid the healthcare system, it will be a native application in which 
                        both employees and employers will be able to use to track time on shift. It will be able 
                        to track incoming patients as well as patients treated and to be treated by the logged in 
                        employee. Through this application, the employee will be able to access all patient 
                        personal and diagnostic information. Also, the system can record what prescription or 
                        medical treatment that the patient needs and the dose of the medication for their treatment.
                         In addition, pharmacist can access the patient’s records right after doctor upload the 
                         information, reduce the time patient needs to wait for and increase the efficiency of 
                         picking the medication with less obstacles.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Motivation </h3>
                    <p>
                        The burden the epidemic has placed on the healthcare system is what spurred development of 
                        this application. The development of this application could streamline hospitals and 
                        improve hospital connection to patients. It could also result in fewer medical errors 
                        because the information needed for each patient would be uniform and clear. Furthermore, 
                        this application help contain and display the records of the patients’ medical treatment 
                        and medication they need, this is transparent for doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and patient 
                        themselves. In addition, a simple chat system will be integrated into the application, this 
                        could bring the relationship between doctors and patients closer, and doctor can answer 
                        some urgent questions from patients and for emergency contact. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, the level of medical care varies from region to region, with some areas having developed and 
                        overflowing medical resources, while others have a lack of medical conditions, and some residents cannot 
                        even receive effective treatment or even examination. Our development team has developed this software with 
                        an international humanitarian vision, and is committed to the efficient use of existing medical resources for 
                        system integration and management, so that the majority of people can receive effective medical treatment and help. 
                        We believe that all people are equal before life. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Description </h3>
                    <p>
                        This application will be able to track employees clocked time in and any overtime accrued over the 
                        period of their shift. The staff will also be able to keep track of any patients who are coming in, 
                        as well as those who are already on their rounds and those who need to be treated. To guarantee that 
                        all information is accurate and that everyone can comprehend the situation with more effective communication, 
                        all diagnostic and personal information, in addition to this kind of patient information, will be accessible 
                        via the application.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patients will be able to receive medicine prescriptions, transfer to other doctors or nurses, or be recommended 
                        to them. The required information such as dosage could be automatically sent to the hospital's pharmacy to be 
                        dispensed and then sent to the nurse so that this can be given to the patient. The system becomes useful in the 
                        way that even if the nurse aiding the patient is now different, the application will have all the required 
                        information to administer the medication to the patient and any previous doses given the patient. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patients can be provided with the most up-to-date medical solutions at the facilities and teams that use the 
                        system, without switching hospitals and residences. The system can integrate all registered medical resources, 
                        which can greatly improve the efficiency of resource utilization and reduce the waste of medical resources. It 
                        is also easier to integrate different patients' conditions for future research on different symptoms and 
                        viruses, and these data will be fed to the registered medical facilities and related teams in real time.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system will also help the registered medical team, the system will be authorized by the medical staff to 
                        test, and the implementation of uploading to the database and analysis, each doctor and medical facility staff 
                        will get real-time physical health and mental data. Especially when dealing with highly contagious diseases and 
                        symptoms, the system will frequently compare patients with their first testers. It also provides feedback on 
                        the mental status of registered staff, for example, if a doctor is under stress, the system will give him/her 
                        a rest or recuperation program with minimal disruption to medical efficiency.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system will use a grading system to rate different registered medical facilities and their staff from big data 
                        to promote the progress of all registered medical facilities. Doctors in the higher segments will have priority 
                        over excellent medical and research resources to realize the potential of the best doctors. Physicians will be 
                        rated by a number of metrics such as attendance, case completion, case symptom difficulty, case success rate, 
                        etc. Salaries and benefits for physicians at different levels will be matched to their capabilities.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, to ensure the best interest of all hard-working medical facilities. The system will analyse the average 
                        income and expenses of the residents in each year and customize the consumption packages for different groups 
                        of people for different consumption levels, and I am willing to provide customized packages to serve customers 
                        with special needs. The more advanced members will receive more medical resources, as well as priority treatment
                         rights. Our software is dedicated to providing the best medical and other related services to all people, and 
                         every user is our most important customer. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tools/Tech </h3>
                    <p>
                        To this day, we are able to gather a number of fundamental data pertaining to computer programming. 
                        Together with UCD, we comprehend mostly how to design a versatile program interface for different 
                        products. To accomplish this, we rely on the information abundant for Java and JavaScript, and index 
                        more about NFC (Near-Field Communication) to speak to devices and outstanding like new media and cell 
                        phones. We will use SQL in information. In addition, Our Bunch should include other features such as 
                        communication, time administration and issue solving methods which help our process of making this 
                        project is more efficient.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Skills</h3>
                    <p>
                        The skills that would be required to complete this project could be fulfilled by all members of the group. 
                        Depending on the platform decided for the project, proficiency in either Swift, Java would be required to 
                        build the application. We would also need someone to build a database that is capable of handling large 
                        amounts of data and can expand as required by the enterprise, as well as someone with skills in cloud design 
                        and cybersecurity as a lot of personal information would be kept within this system from patient information 
                        as well as employer information.  
                    </p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>
                        If this project is successful, this will help doctors, nurses and patients improve the treatment process. 
                        Firstly, we will use Trello to plan our project in detail and update the progress of each step and still 
                        use Microsoft Team for communication. All members will post any new idea or trouble for everyone discuss 
                        and have meeting every week.  Secondly, we will do some research and survey about our project’s interface 
                        and use Figma for design and conceptualise the interface of our tracking application. There will be two 
                        interfaces (one for Doctor and Nurse and other for patients to see reviews from doctor about medicine 
                        prescriptions). Java and JavaScript will be the main language of this project and we choose to deploy the 
                        project on React-Native which is an open-source software UI development kit, so the app can be used for 
                        both Android and IOS operating system. SQL is used for data storage (medicine prescriptions, personal 
                        profile of doctor, nurse and patient, detailed treatment process) and NFC (Near Field Communication) for 
                        tracking location technology.
