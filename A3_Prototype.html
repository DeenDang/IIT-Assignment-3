<h2>Project Description</h2>
            <div class="row1">
                <div class="col3">
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the development of current technology, the application of 
                        medical software plays a very important role in the health care 
                        system. Our project was born as a solution to the impact and 
                        urgency of the epidemic, which is in hospital personnel management 
                        and electronic medical records for the health care system. This 
                        application can help improve the hospital-patient connection and 
                        strengthen the hospital. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many hospitals continue to use paper-based records because they 
                        believe it is the quickest way to manage patient care. When it matters 
                        most, essential information regarding health is either unavailable or 
                        lost in the midst of emergencies. However, if they use electronic 
                        information storage software, they can easily access the patient's 
                        records with a few simple taps on the screen. Patients can also view 
                        their health status and prescriptions after the examination. In addition,
                         we include a working hour management feature to help nurses and doctors
                          understand everything about their shift that day and who works with 
                          them. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>
                    <p>
                        The idea of our project was born from a complaint from nurses working in a 
                        local clinic about scheduling workdays and electronic health records. 
                        The nursing staff can't see who works with them, which is very 
                        inconvenient for them when they want to contact the people who work 
                        with them the same day to exchange work schedules or change shifts. 
                        And more importantly, almost all medical records are recorded on paper, 
                        not online. So it takes a lot of time for the doctor to plan the 
                        treatment or when the patients go to another clinic or hospital, the 
                        doctors and nurses there cannot see the previous medical records. 
                        Therefore, our project will improve the healthcare system in a convenient
                         way. Doctors/Nurses can understand more about the patient's health 
                         condition and doctors/nurses can easily interact with each other with 
                         the common goal of conveying good quality of medical services best to 
                         everyone. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our project is mainly about digitising data which is one of the top 10 
                        technology trends in 2022 according to the Forbes magazine "Data is a 
                        key enabler for all of these trends". Working on this project gives me 
                        many opportunities to land a job in big technology corporations in 
                        software and data such as Google, Amazon, Slack software or in software

                <div class="col3">
                    <h3>Aims</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim of our project is to create a software application with focus on the doctor’s appointment schedule, patient details, medical department collaboration, resources and payrolls. It will be a native application in which both employees and employers will be able to use to track time on shift. And, to track incoming patients as well as patients treated and to be treated by the logged in employee. Through this application, the employee will be able to access all patient personal and diagnostic information. In addition, pharmacist can access the patient’s records right after doctor upload the information, reduce the time patient needs to wait for and increase the efficiency of picking the medication with less obstacles. The development of this application could streamline hospitals and improve hospital connection to patients. It could also result in fewer medical errors because the information needed for each patient would be uniform and clear. Furthermore, by continue this path, we want to create an integrated system based on this software, including the aspects of doctor patient communication, real-time monitoring, medical logistics collaboration, after treatment services, etc.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This application was created because of the impact that this pandemic causes on the healthcare system. The construction of this application. This application was created to simplify hospital operations and strengthen the interaction between hospitals and patients. The uniformity and clarity of the information required for each patient will also prevent medical mistakes. This programme was created by our development team with an international humanitarian approach. And is dedicated to the efficient use of existing medical resources for system integration and management so that most patients may be efficiently treated. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this project, some small goals has been established. For example: main functions for doctors, communication with other departments, resources, payrolls and other features currently won’t be able to express. Because we’re making an application starting with doctors, so we are putting the achievable functions like appointment displaying, patient info & records, departments, schedules, payments, other resources and personal details & payrolls as in high priority. The appointment displaying is the most important function for doctor to visualise and modify the patient’s appointments. In patients’ info & records, the doctors could check the patient’s personal info, medical details, health records and other relate to the patient. In departments function, the doctor could communicate with other departments inside the hospital, this could use as an emergency or general communications with a message and email system. Schedules is a visualised display of appointments and tasks that needs to be done, with a clear, simple visual design and comes with small functions like see details when press into the specific task and could also add tasks with manual if necessary. Payments function is a simple record for any medical payments like Medicare and insurance. In the resources function, we add the section publishing the latest articles in medical field that is relate to the current logging doctor’s field and it is customisable. Also, the doctor could save the articles they like and subscribe the favourable journals for their preference. These categories that has been described will be achieving throughout software creation and they will be containing in the project artifact / potential shippable artifact. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Extra information for this potentially shippable artefact</h4>
                    <h5 style="font-style: italic;">Enhance the doctor-patient relationship </h5>
                    <p>
                        The programme will have a simple chat system. Doctors can respond to patients' urgent inquiries and give emergency assistance. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="font-style: italic;">Improve resource usage efficiency and decrease medical resource waste</h5>
                    <p>
                        The system would combine all registered medical resources, and doctors and facility personnel will have access to real-time physical health and psychological data, allowing them to give patients with up-to-date medical care without requiring them to switch hospitals or homes.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="font-style: italic;">The best doctors will get first access to the best medical and research resources </h5>
                    <p>
                        Numerous measures, such as Attendance, Case Completion, Case Symptom Difficulty, Case Success Rate, etc., will be used to evaluate doctors. The pay of various levels of doctors, as well as the salaries and benefits of different levels of physicians, will be aligned with their skills in order to protect the best interests of all diligent providers. to advance all registered medical institutes 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the project, our group's idea was to develop a simple medical software that doctors could use. It would have features such as being able to see what appointments and other work doctors have, having a freely adjustable weekly schedule, being able to view their salary, being able to view their clock-in and clock-out records and patient appointment information and medical records. The project idea didn't live up to the teacher's claim of having innovative software or games or anything IT related. So, we started adding new features to the original one, which include the ability for doctors to contact and communicate with patients during treatment, the ability for doctors to contact and communicate with doctors in other departments, the ability to monitor in real time the patient's medication and physical condition during medical treatment, the assurance of the latest medical situation and access to the latest medical academic articles. These ideas were also slowly filtered out by our team to try to ensure that the software did not have too large and complex a system, which would otherwise make the development project very difficult and ignore the core purpose of the system by covering too many elements. From the development side, adding too many elements would have made the project extremely difficult and slow, so we removed some early ideas, such as: the users of the software would include doctors, nurses, patients, pharmacists, senior management, medical logistics and the pharmaceutical supply chain. There were too many points to focus on because of the wide coverage.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After talking about the extent covered by this project, the next step for our group was to figure out what kind of development software tools would be used for this project and the ability of the group members to implement these software features. In the group, we listed some of the tools needed to develop the software, including Java, JavaScript, C language, Swift, Python, SQL (in terms of database), and some features that may be needed such as NFC technology. Since our group had no experience in developing software, we could only discuss what programming language to use to write but did not actually apply the tools. In the follow-up process, when we needed to implement some features, we used figma, a tool for developing and presenting user interface features in a mobile simulation on the web. With this software, we were able to create some mobile user interfaces that included some of the features that we proposed. Of course, this page is only in the simulation of the mobile environment, the actual code is difficult for us to implement, with the help of this platform to help us make something that can be used for physical display. During the experiment phase, we have put forward the function and user-friendly interface did come out one by one, including the booking record and list, task lists, patient information and records, other medical departments, week schedule, patients with health insurance and insurance payment records, other medical doctor related resources and personal account Settings and system Settings. The important functions that we have selected represent the core purpose of our initial software project, which is to implement simple clock logging and patient interaction functions for doctors and other ancillary medical functions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the process of project development, I would like to summarize the problems our team has encountered so far, including development, team communication and other problems we have encountered. The first is the development problem. As mentioned in the last paragraph, no one in our group has the ability, skill or experience to develop such software. As a result, our development process is relatively slow, and we have to consider the size of the software to judge whether some functions are suitable to add and apply to the software. Among the high priority functions, we select the highest priority registration and login function first. This feature is clean and simple, there's not much to talk about. The next function we chose to add a dashboard, in this interface we added some areas to show the doctor/user need to see the upcoming appointment brief content, patient name, appointment time, disease information and complete, cancel buttons to the doctor to change the appointment function. Then on this interface we want to add some other content, such as the latest hospital information and medical related academic content and news content. Finally, add a tasks section that displays the proportions of completed, incomplete, and timeout to give the doctor/user a sense of which tasks need to be done. In this process, our team encountered problems such as interface selection, section division and display information. For the interface selection, we discussed whether it would be enough to show most of the information or only show two or three important information. In the end, we chose the simple interface option, leaving only some important information on the home page. When we do the user interface for patient information and records, we use the search bar, then the patient list, and then when the doctor clicks on a patient in the patient list, all the relevant personal information, medical information and past records, medical content and other history records about that patient are displayed. When we wrote the interfaces of other medical departments, we could only write some departments because we didn't understand the medical system. When click on a specific department, it will display the basic information and contact information of the department, as well as the contact information of some doctors of the department, so as to ensure that each department can help and cooperate with each other. When creating the schedule interface, we chose a simple weekly schedule and included details from 0 to 24 hour. While this schedule seems simple and easy to understand, we also want to add some small features to the schedule, such as the ability to drag tasks to change the time, manually add, change or delete task contents, and find tasks. These little features are not currently in the prototype. We didn't plan to spend too much time on the payment screen, so we made two sliding-table lists to show the patient's insurance or insurance payment information, including payment time, process time, and how much they paid. The last screen is resources, which is not as high a priority as the previous ones, but we thought it would be a good feature to put there. This has medical related academic papers, medical articles, and hospital related information. Of course, you can also save want to see or not read the article, you can also subscribe to personal like some articles press. Finally, there are some small features, such as payrolls, software Settings, account Settings and logout. The content of these little features has not been determined yet, but they will function as they appear. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At present, although our progress is slow, we still follow the plan. What our group lacks most is communication with each other. Communication is essential in this kind of project group, and we didn't do it very well. Our group never really met a dead end. First of all, we don't have too much trouble in development technology, and the reason for meeting dead ends is that we don't have much discussion. When we give the problem to each team member and ask them to give the answer, there will be no dead ends, and the problem will be solved after discussion. Most of the team members are shy, and they will not actively answer questions or give plans for discussion. They will only wait or expect a speaker to control and lead the audience most of the time.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, from the idea of this project to the development process, we did not experience too many development problems, group problems and theoretical understanding problems. These also show that our group did not organize too many meetings to discuss the content. Basically, one person proposed, and the others did not object. As for the idea of this project, our team still agrees to develop the necessary software for doctors to clock in and clock out, check appointment content, patient information and other necessary or required functions. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Roles</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clearly defining the roles of each team member and planning specific and detailed steps to complete the project is an essential part of the success of this project. Our team currently consists of five members and each has played an important role in this project related to personnel management and electronic record keeping and in-depth knowledge of the database. All members study and learn similar applications of workforce scheduling and management platforms and electronic health records software. Deen Dang will be project manager for our project. Minh Hoang Pham and Janella Bernardini will assume the position of designing the interface and coding based on the website application so that this application can be used on tablets, phones and computers. Deen Dang and Zeyi Li will handle the security part of the application. Besides, the two of them will also support Yiwei LIn in the system administration. All team members will jointly design the database and do the testing together. After 2 weeks, we decided to change our roles and responsibilities. Minh Hoang Pham, Janella Bernardini and Zeyi Li will handle the database design and cloud based. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through this application, staff will have access to all patients' personal and diagnostic information. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system will also keep track of the patient's prescriptions or medical treatments, as well as their dosages. Even if the nurse who administered the medicine to the patient is no longer there, the application will include all the required information to deliver the medication. Medications and past dosages given to the patient will be accessible to the patient in the facility and team using the system, allowing the patient to get the most up-to-date medical care. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our project will feature two user interfaces, one for physicians and nurses and the other for patients to see physicians' comments on prescription medicine orders. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our idea will not only assist the medical staff in getting to know the patients, but it will also assist the patients in getting to know the medical personnel, so that they become better acquainted. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A simple chat system will be integrated into the application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Doctors may respond to patients' urgent inquiries and make emergency connections. This function only permits basic typing and the transmission of speech videos and images; it does not support the transmission of location information, emoticons, etc. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>
                        figma, Swift, Java and JavaScript, sql database are required for this project. All are free or have educational versions available. There are no specific hardware requirements (other than computers and phones for software testing). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We used figma to design UI and prototypes, and all the team members had experience in user center design, so we understood how to design a common program interface for different products, and it was easy for users to understand and operate. Swift, Java and JavaScript are used to write apps on Apple and Android, respectively. We have some experience with Java development, but swift needs to learn from scratch. And SQL, we need it to process data and information. We have completed the database and SQL courses and could write some SQL programs. I believe these experiences will be helpful for our project. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our project will be evaluated in four parts. During this procedure, we will conduct user testing to verify that the application is intuitive enough for users of all skill levels. <br><br> First, we will do unit testing to validate functionality, test it independently, and search for faults in areas of the project that can be tested separately. This involves ensuring that each page's functionality is implemented. <br><br> Integration testing then follows, during which the separate software components are combined and tested as a whole. Assembled and evaluated as a unit. For example, our program's full usual operation is functioning well. <br><br> System testing follows, which comprises crucial tests such as functional testing, user interface testing, interface testing, stress testing, reliability testing, and security testing. We will investigate the market's numerous operating system types, including Windows, Mac, Unix, and Linux, to see whether they can execute this test. <br><br> Acceptance testing is the last step of this process; it assesses if the software fulfils the functional requirements provided in the project requirements. Requirements. The purpose of content testing is to verify the correctness, accuracy, and relevancy of the offered material. The correctness, precision, and relevancy of the presented information. <br><br> To test our applications, we include user testing into our teaching sessions wherever feasible.

                    <h3>Risks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Database plays an important role in our project. Programmers need to process large amounts of data related to patient medical records. The fact is that there is no member of our team with any specialized database expertise. Besides, Security is also a necessary part of our application. Confidentiality needs to be high to not leak out patient record data. Some of the team members already have a basic knowledge of security but that's still not enough for such a highly practical project. Finally, system administrators and software developers need to learn more advanced knowledge about their specialty to make this application more professional. <br><br> There is also a risk that our ideas in the project are not complete enough compared to other competitors in the market. There are many Electrical Health Record software on the market. Most of them are created by professionals with extensive experience in this industry. So, for students like us, failure is inevitable. But this highly practical project is a good opportunity for them to have the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in the course and from that to draw a lot of experience from our future work.

                    <h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this assignment the group was more dedicated to communication, we set up new channels to communicate as we found that communicating through Teams was ineffective. We discussed in the first meeting for assignment 3 that WhatsApp would be the best option for those in and out of the country. Through WhatsApp it was easy to ensure that everyone stayed on tasks and checking in with meetings and such. Our weekly meeting was expected to happen on Tuesdays during the tutorial although sometimes it had to be moved to that night or the next as people couldn’t make it but we still wanted to ensure the meeting went ahead. We found that some group members had it harder than others to communicate at times as they were in different time zones or didn’t speak as fluently as others, although we ensured that we were constantly checking to make sure that everyone was having no issues on their parts, if someone was unable to communicate that, then we would message them directly through WhatsApp and if still no response we would speak to the course mentor, luckily we didn’t have these issues.

                        An information architect would be essential in building a software 
                        where it is heavily based on users especially where there are multiple 
                        types of users to cater for such as in our project. Information 
                        architects work with stakeholders as well as the front end software 
                        engineers to create a front end that suits the clients needs while
