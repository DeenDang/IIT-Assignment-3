                    <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
                    <p>An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment 
                        and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not 
                        required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human 
                        passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous 
                        car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an 
                        experienced human driver does. Between 1920 and 1980 many efforts 
                        had been made by various car companies and Universities to pioneer 
                        autonomous vehicles. One of the first demonstrations was a 
                        radio-controlled driver-less car in the 1920’s. This still required 
                        a second car behind to send out radio signals to the transmitting 
                        antennae that was installed in the ‘driver-less’ vehicle in front 
                        (The Milwaukee Sentinel 1926). A few decades later, people 
                        considered driver-less cars that could be activated by electronic 
                        devices embedded in the roadway. This would mean construction of 
                        new electronically controlled streets; these were considered in the 
                        UK and parts of the US. There are different levels of vehicle 
                        autonomy – from complete driver control to completely automated 
                        with no driver input. The National Highway Traffic Safety 
                        Administration (NHTSA) in America have put forward the following 
                        classification for autonomous vehicles. </p>
                        <p>
                            ~   No-Automation (Level 0): At all times, the driver has completed 
                            and sole command and control of the vehicle with respect to steering, 
                            braking, throttle and motive power
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ~   Function-specific automation (Level 1): Some specific control 
                            functions such as electronic stability control or pre-charged brakes 
                            is(car) automated 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ~   Combined function automation (Level 2): At least two main control 
                            functions such as adaptive cruise control in combination with lane 
                            centring are automated 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ~   Limited self-driving automation (Level 3): Under certain traffic 
                            or environmental conditions, the driver cedes full control of all 
                            safety – critical functions and relies heavily on the vehicle to 
                            watch for any changes in conditions requiring transition to driver 
                            control. The driver will be required to resume control of the vehicle, 
                            but with sufficient transition time 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ~   Full self-driving automation (Level 4) The vehicle is intelligently 
                            designed to monitor roadway conditions and act solo, performing all 
                            safety–critical driving functions for an entire trip (a fully driverless 
                            level)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors, algorithms, machine learning systems, 
                            and powerful processors to execute software. Autonomous vehicles create and
                             maintain a map of their surroundings based on a variety of sensors situated 
                             in different parts of the vehicle. Radar sensors monitor the position of 
                             nearby vehicles. Video cameras detect traffic lights, read road signs, 
                             track other vehicles, and look for pedestrians. Lidar (light detection and 
                             ranging) sensors bounce pulses of light off the car’s surroundings to 
                             measure distances, detect road edges, and identify lane markings. Ultrasonic
                              sensors in the wheels detect curbs and other vehicles when parking. 
                              Sophisticated software then processes all this sensory input, plots a path,
                               and sends instructions to the car’s actuators, which control acceleration,
                                braking, and steering. Hard-coded rules, obstacle avoidance algorithms,
                                 predictive modelling, and object recognition help the software follow 
                                 traffic rules and navigate obstacles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A number of car companies have predicted the fully autonomous vehicles will be 
                            on the market within the next 5-10 years - this includes Audi in 2017 
                            (Torr, 2014), Ford in 2020 (Su, 2015), Nissan in 2020 (Nissan, 2013) and Tesla 
                            in 2023 (Kaufman, 2014). Google is probably most advanced, and they plan to 
                            have a driverless car in the market by 2018 (Tam, 2012).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything has positive and negative impacts from its inception, and autonomous 
                            vehicle technology is no exception. The future era of driverless cars will bring 
                            us the following five advantages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1. Safety: 
                            Studies show that approximately 94% of car crashes are caused by human error, 
                            resulting in more than 1 million deaths worldwide each year. With the advent of 
                            new partially autonomous vehicles, especially those equipped with collision 
                            warning systems, some crashes have been avoided.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. Cost savings: 
                            Car accidents cause billions of dollars in economic damage each year, especially 
                            in terms of property damage and medical costs. For car owners and taxpayers, a 
                            reduction in injury accidents and fatalities would naturally reduce these costs 
                            significantly, as taxpayers pay taxes that are primarily used to pay for medical 
                            expenses and road construction costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. Environment: 
                            Driverless cars will be able to travel more efficiently on the road than cars 
                            operated by human drivers, which will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas 
                            emissions, specifically for a number of reasons. First, the reduced number of 
                            accidents will help reduce traffic congestion on the road. Vehicles will also 
                            likely communicate with road infrastructure (e.g., traffic signals), which in 
                            turn will adjust fuel consumption and emissions accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4. Transportation services: 
                            Cab services, car sharing, and public transportation will become faster and cheaper
                             as driverless vehicle changes advance. As mentioned earlier, as traffic 
                             congestion decreases and navigation becomes more efficient, vehicles will be 
                             able to reach their destinations faster. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5. Time Savings: 
                            With driverless cars on the market, navigation will be more efficient, traffic 
                            congestion will be reduced, and because cabs and car-sharing services will be 
                            cheaper than purchasing a car, there will be fewer cars on the road, which will 
                            ultimately improve commuting efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the negative side, autonomous vehicle technology can lead to unemployment for 
                            taxi drivers and bus drivers, the acceptance of this new technology and how to 
                            develop appropriate laws. Unemployment will be a problem in the short and medium 
                            term and will require government support and security in exchange for social 
                            stability. People's acceptance of this new technology depends on safety and trust 
                            issues, if people's lives are not safe or in danger, it will be difficult to 
                            accept this technology in daily life. Finally, the government needs to consider 
                            how to take responsibility for accidents and penalties if an autonomous vehicle 
                            is involved in an accident.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This technology will have a big impact on me and my family and friends. First, 
                            it will affect my means of travel, for example, because of the massive popularity 
                            of autonomous vehicles, he will replace the current bus and taxi, so my travel is 
                            completely dependent on autonomous vehicles. Secondly, driving will reduce the 
                            risk of car accidents as much as possible, so it will not need to put a lot of 
                            energy into driving, driving will become easier than ever. Then parking will not 
                            be a problem, I do not need to operate it myself, artificial intelligence 
                            operation will be far better than human operation. Finally, there will be less 
                            traffic congestion and more efficient driving, which will greatly optimize time 
                            management.

                    <h3>Cloud</h3>
                    <p>Cloud servers came into fruition in the 1960s by Joseph Carl Robnett Locklider, 
                        he was a phycologist and computer science that wanted to connect people all over the world. 
                        By the 2000s, technology powerhouse companies such as Amazon and Microsoft were introducing 
                        their own cloud computing services (Educba). </p>
                    <p>Modern cloud services allow companies to make resources accessible to people over a remote 
                        network or online interface. We may not realise how often we use these things in our 
                        everyday life, from school to work and even at home, these services make things such as 
                        accessing school resources via a school portal, working remotely, and syncing your information 
                        across all your devices. This means that the cloud servers are the heart of any cloud computing 
                        service, and they can be delivered in multiple ways, Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a 
                        Service or Software as a Service and Function as a Service, the platform can also be deployed in
                        different ways depending on the enterprise’s preferences. They can be deployed in a public way 
                        the third part provider makes the resource available to the general public over the internet, 
                        an example of this service is the Google Cloud. It can be also deployed in a private way where 
                        an enterprise will use a proprietary architecture and will run  the cloud with its own data centre, 
                        the enterprise will have their own hardware on premises and have all control of underlying cloud
                        infrastructure. Lastly, they can also be deployed in a hybrid way which combines features of both 
                        public and private.</p>
                    <p>Cloud severs come into existence through a process called virtualisation which makes use of a 
                        software called a hypervisor also known as a virtual machine monitor, this software creates 
                        and supports multiple virtual machines by creating one host computer capable of running multiple 
                        guest virtual machines. It divides and shares the resources of the host computer such as its 
                        memory and processors. In a public setting the resources are split and used by multiple organisations 
                        and/or individuals, with dedicated private servers, owners or renters are provided with their own 
                        physical server which the hypervisor virtualises but does not split the resources.</p>
                    <p>As technology continues to evolve, these virtual machines will likely become much more secure, 
                        with security systems becoming more integrated with AI and machine learning, this will help 
                        automate all the processes of threat prevention as well as risk detection. We will also likely 
                        find ourselves to become more integrated with technology with things such as Internet of Things 
                        (IoT) technology which allows someone to manage all their smart devices from a central hub and 
                        Multi-cloud platforms which would allow people to integrate all their cloud providers into one 
                        central space. One of the largest growing platforms for the cloud service is serverless computing 
                        also known as Function as a Service, this is where developers do not need to manage the cloud 
                        server and all they need to do is write and deploy their application code.</p>
                    <p>The continued development of this sector of technology means we will likely mean we will continue
                        to become more intwined with technology we will see the positive and negatives of this relationship 
                        between societies growing dependence on technology. In 2021, Nassim Khadem reported that the Australian 
                        Cyber Security Centre received a cybercrime report at least once every 10 minutes which turns out to be 
                        approx. 164 a day, we will likely see this number rise with cybercrimes such as malware installation 
                        where people might unknowingly download a resource from an unsecure cloud server that contains a computer 
                        virus which could possibly lead to these people having personal information stolen which thus may lead 
                        to identity theft. This will greatly affect many people in their day to day lives as well as the 
                        possibility of these people’s jobs going redundant. Jobs such as accountants, assembly line workers, 
                        bank tellers are among some of the careers that are susceptible to the advancements of technology. 
                        There are also jobs that will be more sought after such as software developers and Customer Experience 
                        Specialists and online teachers as well as some jobs that will need to be instated such as 3D Printer 
                        technicians, smart home designers and human-machine team managers. </p>
                    <p>For people like us, this innovation in the IT sector makes it possible to broaden one’s horizons, even 
                        though it currently feels like there are many pathways to go down those pathways will continue to split 
                        and new pathways will be created. This should excite people in the IT world with the possibility of 
                        creating new things and discovering more about what possibilities there are. The future development of 
                        cloud servers will mean that people like me will have easier access to resources needed for things such 
                        as school and work and will likely mean that as our careers progress, we will likely be able to work from 
                        anywhere in the world. While this might excite people in IT, this might make others worried, as generations 
                        continue to change, technology does with it, older generations start feeling more and more out of the loop 
                        with the newest tech. They might feel like they do not know how to integrate their lives with the new 
                        technology coming out, at least I know that the older generations in my family do. Nevertheless, technology 
                        will keep evolving and we will move with it. </p><br>

                    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                    <h3>What does it do?  </h3>
                    <p>Learning by machines is a subfield in artificial intelligence. The evolution of artificial 
                        intelligence follows a clear and logical progression from "reasoning" through "knowing" to 
                        "learning." Evidently, machine learning is a method for achieving artificial intelligence, 
                        i.e., it is utilised to address issues in artificial intelligence. In the last 30 years, machine 
                        learning has evolved into a multidisciplinary area incorporating probability theory, statistics, 
                        approximation theory, convex analysis, and computational complexity theory, among others. 
                        The construction and study of algorithms that enable computers to "learn" automatically is 
                        the subject of machine learning theory. Machine learning algorithms are a family of algorithms 
                        that automatically examine data to identify patterns and then use those patterns to draw 
                        inferences about unknown data. Due to the substantial amount of statistical theory involved 
                        in learning algorithms, machine learning has a tight relationship with inferential statistics 
                        and is also known as statistical learning theory. Machine learning theory is concerned with 
                        established, implementable learning algorithms in terms of algorithm design. Numerous inference 
                        issues come under the category of no-procedure-to-follow difficulty, hence machine learning 
                        research includes the development of simple approximation techniques.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Machine learning generates algorithms that enable computers to better comprehend data and make 
                        decisions based on it. Some analysts predict that machine learning will become widespread by 2024, 
                        with particular focus on the years 2022 and 2023. Data mining, computer vision, natural language 
                        processing, biometric recognition, search engines, medical diagnosis, credit card fraud detection, 
                        stock market analysis, DNA sequence sequencing, speech and handwriting recognition, strategic gaming, 
                        and robotics have all utilised machine learning extensively. There are a range of learning models using 
                        distinct algorithms within machine learning. Learning models may be divided into four categories based 
                        on the nature of the data and the intended outcome: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
                        semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, one or more algorithms may be used to 
                        each model based on the dataset employed and the desired outcomes. The primary functions of machine 
                        learning algorithms include classification, discovery of patterns, result prediction, and the making 
                        of informed choices. Generally, algorithms are employed alone; however, if the data being processed is 
                        very complicated and unexpected, numerous algorithms may be combined to enhance accuracy. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Machine learning algorithms can rapidly and correctly measure ROI by identifying patterns and connections. 
                        This capability allows organisations investing in machine learning to swiftly measure its operational 
                        effect. Below are some fast-growing corporate machine learning applications. Recommenders: From 2009 to 
                        2017, streaming video subscriptions quadrupled among U.S. homes. Forbes 2020 estimated a 70% growth in 
                        streaming video consumption. Various retail and shopping sites employ recommendation algorithms. 
                        Recommendation engines will be useful for streaming music and video. Dynamic marketing: Companies must 
                        acquire and analyse consumer data to find prospects and steer them along the sales funnel. Modern 
                        customers create a lot of unstructured data, from chat logs to uploaded photographs. With machine 
                        learning, marketers can better analyse this data and send customised marketing material to current 
                        and new consumers in real time. ERP databases include sales performance stats, customer reviews, market 
                        trend reports, and supply chain management records. Machine learning algorithms can find patterns in 
                        this data. These insights may be used to optimise IoT device workflow in the network and automate 
                        repetitive or error-prone processes. Modern supply chains and smart factories use IoT devices and 
                        machinery and cloud connection across fleets and operations teams for predictive maintenance. Failures 
                        and inefficiencies may cause costly company disruptions. Manually capturing maintenance and repair data 
                        makes it difficult for firms to forecast and avoid issues. IoT gateway sensors may improve visibility 
                        and efficiency on decades-old analogue machinery. </p>
                    <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
                    <p>
                        In histopathology, where AI promises to minimise the burden of human specialists, enhance the objectivity 
                        and consistency of pathology reports, and provide therapeutic effect by extracting hidden information from 
                        frequently collected data, machine learning is also commonly used. And the use of artificial intelligence to 
                        predict cancer outcomes, treatment response, genetic changes, and gene expression based on digital 
                        histopathology sections. Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Oncology and Cancer Research. AI is beginning 
                        to dominate the ceramics industry. Quality control uses machine learning techniques. Various algorithms can 
                        anticipate material behaviour under severe temperatures and discover tile abnormalities and faults. Artificial 
                        intelligence research seeks to forecast anomalous material behaviour during production, allowing for more 
                        resistant components. By recognising faulty patterns, they may spot product irregularities early, saving waste 
                        and enhancing profitability. Several firms in this field and others use this technology now. They're ceramics, 
                        porcelain, and flooring enterprises.

                        <p>
                        AI is also utilised to enhance car manufacturing processes. All automotive-related sectors use machine learning 
                        to boost sales. This method predicts component durability and identifies faults and flaws early. Machine 
                        learning optimises the automotive supply chain. This is a great chance to increase car manufacturing. They 
                        have superior control over inventory levels in various facilities. Machine learning is helping more automakers 
                        boost output.

                        <p>
                        Machine learning is improving installation and energy management using AI. This technology creates smart 
                        networks and grids. This sort of network will utilise machine learning for real-time analytics to better match 
                        power supply to demand by recognising consumption trends and intercepting supply chain faults or fraud. Other 
                        developments in energy management include enhancing network management and optimisation, door-to-door service, 
                        pricing optimisation, regional growth forecasts, and detecting consumption and demand peaks or customer or city 
                        behaviour. AI helps people and companies manage urban energy. Smart grid will save $14 billion in energy 
                        expenses by 2022, according to one research. Using powerful machine learning platforms to enhance city energy 
                        management, several organisations in this market are already enjoying these advantages.

                        Artificial intelligence reduces costs and improves quality in the food business. It does so in food, drink, 
                        and restaurant industries. This gives the sector significant commercial benefits. One benefit is monitoring 
                        the food industry to identify consumer trends and meet their wants. Machine learning improves plant hygiene. 
                        It can identify filthy machinery or verify the cleanliness of manufacturing employees. Food and beverage 
                        supply chains are optimised using machine learning. Many food industries now use AI, or machine learning.

                    <h3>BlockChain and cryptocurrencies</h3>
                    <h3>Ethereum merger </h3>
                    <p>These days, Ethereum will usher in a merger. What is an Ethereum merger? The Ethereum 
                        Foundation gives a precise definition of the term: "A merger represents the combination of 
                        Ethereum's existing execution layer (the main net we use today) and its new proof-of-stake 
                        consensus layer, the Beacon Chain." More precisely, it is said that the beacon chain (consensus 
                        layer) is merged with the existing chain (execution layer), and the PoW part of the original 
                        execution layer is discarded. The completion of this merger means the end of the Ethereum POW 
                        consensus era, and the POW node miners will withdraw from the historical stage. </p><br>
                    <p>PoW may seem perfect, but what is most easily criticized and criticized is the energy consumption 
                        necessary to ensure network security. As the computing power of the entire network increases, 
                        energy consumption also increases rapidly. On the development planning roadmap of Ethereum, the 
                        PoW mechanism will gradually withdraw from the historical stage, and Ethereum will transition to 
                        PoS (Proof of Stake) and gradually phase out the PoW mining mechanism. It should be emphasized 
                        that the energy and computing power consumed by PoW create the security barrier of the network - 
                        the 51% attack principle determines the desire to attack a system with strong computing power 
                        (systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum also carry considerable Wealth of volume), it must be 
                        uneconomical in terms of cost. Therefore, an economic constraint can be reached between network 
                        wealth value, network computing power, and network security. However, the corresponding price is 
                        energy consumption (which will be under pressure under the social consensus of green energy saving) 
                        and the threshold for participating in mining. PoS is anticipated to lower the network's energy 
                        usage by at least 99.95% when compared to Ethereum's present resource-intensive PoW governance scheme. </p><br>
                        <p>The entire upgrade process of Ethereum is divided into three steps: 1) beacon chain, 2) merge, 3) 
                            shard network. And it is currently in the critical second step- the merger - from pow to pos. </p><br>
                    <p>Merge has long been in the development plan of Ethereum. In order to smooth the transition, the 
                        beacon chain was first introduced on PoW. However, in the face of mature PoW miners and a developed 
                        mining machine industry, the merger is not easy, and the differences of interests and technical 
                        obstacles it faces are also obvious. In order to make the established PoS route go smoothly and make 
                        the transition as low as possible, the latest development state on the eve of the merger is Ethereum 
                        2.0. By introducing the beacon chain (ETH2.0), it runs based on the underlying PoW block and runs in 
                        the letter. The development of sharding on the standard chain. </p><br>
                    <p>The merged block data structure remains unchanged, and the useless fields are set to 0 or equivalent. 
                        After merging, several fields that were previously included in the proof-of-work block header are no 
                        longer helpful. However, in order to minimize disruption to tools and infrastructure, these fields are 
                        entirely removed from the data structure and are instead set to 0 or the corresponding Equivalent value. 
                        In this way, the impact of the merger is minimized for application implementations and developers. </p><br>
                    <p>Additionally, it will open the door for sharded chains in 2023, which are anticipated to remove data congestion, 
                        high gas (transaction) costs, and support layer 2 scaling systems of the next generation. The Ethereum Foundation 
                        claims that sharded chains give rollups and applications a second, less expensive storage layer for data storage. </p><br>
                    <h4>Why Ethereum should be upgraded </h4>
                        <p>There are two main reasons for the upgrade of Ethereum: 1) the pow mining mode requires a lot of energy consumption,
                         which is not conducive to environmental protection; 2) the current Ethereum network is over-congested, and the high 
                         gas fee limits the user experience, and Affect the development of the project party. </p><br>
                    <p>This time the Ethereum merger is mainly a solution to the first reason. The pos mechanism can completely change the 
                        energy consumption of mining. It is worth mentioning that "merging" cannot solve the problem of high gas, and the 
                        sharding technology proposed for high gas, which is the third step of the Ethereum upgrade, will be implemented in 
                        2023. </p><br>
                    <h4>What happens after the merger? </h4>
                    <p>The merger's main objective is to hasten the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Developers are trying to
                         remove features that can cause delays and temporarily limit the ability to withdraw staked ETH when the merger is 
                         complete in order to speed up the transfer. However, a combined "clean" update might be able to fix problems. </p><br>
                    <h4>The impact of this merger </h4>
                    <p>The most directly affected are the miners who use computers to mine. The upgrade of pos will cause many machines to be 
                        unable to continue to mine ETH. There are two solutions for them. The first is to use machines to mine other currencies, 
                        such as ETC. Second, sell the machine and replace it with tokens to continue participating in pos mining. Therefore, 
                        it is foreseeable in the future that the number of second-hand graphics cards on the market will increase, and the demand 
                        for ETH will increase in the short term. </p><br>
                    <p>In addition, many miners will choose to switch to ETC. The equipment is ready-made, and mining can continue if a client is 
                        changed. However, ETC is not ETH, and it is estimated that miners who choose to mine ETC will soon face a large amount of 
                        ETC selling pressure. </p><br>
                    <p>This merger news is a boost to the sluggish market. After all, the upgrade of Ethereum is the number one event in the entire 
                        encryption world. However, due to the difficulty and unpredictability of many situations, no one can guarantee that it will 
                        be smooth in the end. In the short term, the market will rise for a period of time with this good news, but the entire U.S. 
                        interest rate hike cycle has not ended, and market volatility is still relatively large. </p><br>
                    <p>The Ethereum upgrade, in general, has these effects 1. Lower gas fees 2. Increase network throughput 3. Democratize network 
                        participation and distribute rewards more equitably through new incentives, validators, and innovations 4. Go green, 99.95% 
                        of energy consumption will be reduced in each transaction 5. Complete deflation, reducing the issuance of ETH and providing 
                        users with more robust security 6. It increased pledge income 7. Reduced GPU price 8. It is expanding the Ethereum ecosystem 
                        9. Helps reduce future code complexity 10. Be more sustainable </p><br>
                    <h4>After the merger, the impact on me. </h4>
                    <p>I cannot continue to use the PoW version of Ethereum, the entire network of Ethereum will switch to the PoS consensus mechanism.
                         If I were to continue mining the PoW version of Ethereum, the economic value of my block rewards would be much less than my 
                         operating costs, so I want to continue mining with my hardware, I must move to something other than ether on the PoW blockchain 
                         of the Square. But to be honest, I stopped mining in Ethereum as early as half a year ago, because the profit was close to 
                         nothing. Now I only hope that Ethereum 2.0 can drive the entire virtual currency circle to have a certain increase. I can sell 
                         my remaining LUNC, withdraw from the circle and leave the market, so as to avoid losing everything. </p><br>
